                <h2>HBO's The Last Of Us Renewed For Season 2</h2>
                <p>With HBO's The Last of Us poised to become one of the most successful video game adaptations of all time, it was only a matter of time until a second season was greenlit. We might only be two episodes in at the time of writing, but HBO has officially renewed the show for a second season. While we don't know anything about the season so far, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann tweeted "Part II —> HBO", suggesting the second game will be adapted once the current season is over.</p>

                <h2>Tomb Raider TV Show Reportedly In The Works At Amazon</h2>
                <p>Over at Amazon, it must be looking over at HBO with envy as it seems to be adapting as many video games as it can hoping something sticks. Alongside God of War and Fallout, it's now been reported that Amazon has a Tomb Raider TV show in the development stages, with Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge set to write the scripts. It's also reported that, despite her playing a leading role in Fleabag, Waller-Bridge will not be taking on the role of Lara Croft.</p>

                <h2>Dungeons & Dragons Cancels Plans To Change The OGL</h2>
                <p>Dungeons & Dragons fans have been celebrating today as they've successfully managed to convince Wizards of the Coast to cancel controversial plans to change the Open Games License. After receiving a wave of negative feedback upon the presentation of the OGL 1.2 draft, Wizards has finally realised there isn't much room for negotiation with this one. Along with leaving the original OGL 1.0a untouched, Wizards has also made the entire SRD 5.1 available under the Creative Commons License.</p>
